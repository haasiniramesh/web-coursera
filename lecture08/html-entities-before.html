	<p>&quot;In the 1st Test of Border -Gavaskar trophy(2001), India were going comfortable at 103/2, in the 2nd innings, with Sachin and Dravid at crease. Dravid at the striker's end, mistimed a pull shot which fell into the hands, or as replays showed, just short, of Michael Slater's grasp in India's&nbsp;first&nbsp;innings.&quot;</p>
